# pathfinding
A Java implementation of a pathfinder, including heightmaps, distance, and heuristics.

Here are some commands that you can run for InteractivePathfinderVisualizer:
 * C - clear path
 * Space - recompute path
 * S - set start location to mouse
 * E - set end location to mouse
 * Left - half path search heuristic value
 * Right - double path search heuristic value
 * 0/1 - set path search heuristic to 0 or 1
 * W - start a walker to show the path (still in development)
 * R - randomly generate a new terrain               
 * M - smooths terrain under mouse                  
 * Shift+M - smooths all terrain                          
 * Up/Down        increase/decrease terrain under mouse
